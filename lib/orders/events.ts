/**
 * Canonical order-event catalog (pure, unit-tested).
 *
 * Every state-changing operation writes exactly one of these types via
 * logOrderEvent(). The union is closed: clients cannot manufacture
 * events (there is no API accepting an event type), and the database
 * CHECK mirrors this list. STATUS_CHANGED exists ONLY as a bucket for
 * pre-catalog legacy rows (see 0021 backfill) — new code never writes
 * it, and it is hidden from customers.
 *
 * Metadata allowlist: operational facts only (payment method, counts,
 * totals, invoice number). Anything identifying or secret — UTRs,
 * phones, emails, addresses, GSTINs, tokens — is rejected by
 * assertEventMetadata() so it can never reach a timeline.
