/**
 * Order lifecycle transitions (pure, unit-tested).
 *
 * Canonical customer-visible flow:
 *   pending_payment → payment_submitted → confirmed → processing →
 *   dispatched → delivered
 * Legacy/edge states (draft/paid/shipped) sit on the same spine and
 * move forward identically. Cancellation is customer-initiated only
 * before fulfilment starts (draft/pending_payment/payment_submitted);
 * everything later is admin-controlled. Terminal states (delivered,
 * cancelled) have no exits.
 *
 * One designed backward step exists: payment_submitted → pending_payment
 * when an admin rejects a payment claim, reopening the order for a
 * retry. It is explicit here — not an arbitrary jump.
 *
 * Enforced wherever statuses change server-side (claim API now, admin
 * mutations next) so arbitrary jumps are structurally impossible.
